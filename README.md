Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project I have created a website of a furniture company using HTML and css only.
Since I am using html and css so this website only  consits of pages and link.
I have added shopping page but shooping feature is not included since it cannot be added ony using html and css.
My website consist of 4 pages (i.e 4 HTML files) and 2 css files one for primary styling and another for mobile.
My website is not completely mobile friendly but i have tried to make it good for iphone X only.
